# Ruby Project

## This repo will be utilized to the learning of Ruby with a Udemy's course.

The primary branch is called "main".

The branch "chapters_one_to_three" contains the section 1 to 3 of the Udemy's course.


### Chapter One
It includes a basic file showing a simple method and Ruby's own extension.


### Chapter TWo
It includes files with three output methods:
- puts
- print
- p


The basic arithmetics methods:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Concatentation
- Division
- Exponentiation
- Module


Later, there're examples of creating variables and constants.

Continue with the form for parallel variable assignment and swapping variable values.


The basic methods of objects are explored:
- length
- upcase
- downcase
- next
- inspect


Subsequently, the string interpolation, with the forms/methods to_s, to convert a object in an object of type string and later concatenate and print it, and #{variable/expression} to do what is indicated inside the braces and then convert it to a string that can be internally concatenated and printed.


Finally, the gets and chomp methods are used to capture typing data.
- gets, captures the data including the line break.
- chomp, removes the line break captured by gets.
