# Ruby Project

## This repo will be utilized to the learning of Ruby with a Udemy's course.

The primary branch is called "main".

The branch "chapters_one_to_three" contains the section 1 to 3 of the Udemy's course.

The branch "chapters_four_to_six" contains the section 4 to 6 of the Udemy's course.

Rubocop is implemented using the apply-rubocop-up-to-chapter-six branch from chapter #1 to #6 of the Udemy's course. From chapter #7 onwards, it is implemented in the branch of each tern.

The branch "chapters-seven-to-nine" contains the section 7 to 9 of the Udemy's course.

The branch "chapters-ten-to-twelve" contains the section 10 to 12 of the Udemy's course.


### Chapter One
It includes a basic file showing a simple method and Ruby's own extension.


### Chapter Two
It includes files with three output methods:
- puts
- print
- p


The basic arithmetics methods:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Concatentation (+)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (**)
- Module (%)


Later, there're examples of creating variables and constants.

Continue with the form for parallel variable assignment and swapping variable values.


The basic methods of objects are explored:
- length
- upcase
- downcase
- next
- inspect


Subsequently, the string interpolation, with the forms/methods to_s, to convert a object in an object of type string and later concatenate and print it, and #{variable/expression} to do what is indicated inside the braces and then convert it to a string that can be internally concatenated and printed.


Finally, the gets and chomp methods are used to capture typing data.
- gets, captures the data including the line break.
- chomp, removes the line break captured by gets.



### Chapter Three
It includes the operation of numbers and Booleans. It also contains useful methods for each data type.

There are two types of numerical object:
- Integer: Previously differentiated in Fixnum and Bignum p to ruby version 2.4
- Float


As for Boolean objects, they are divided into two types
- TrueClass
- FalseClass

Both are Boolean but a subdifferentiation is performed.


The chapter contains the following methods:
- next
- class
- to_i
- to_f
- to_s
- odd?
- even?
- between?
- floor
- ceil
- round
- abs


Logical operators are also included:
- Equality (==)
- Inequality (!=)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than (>)
- Less or equal to (<=)
- Greater or equal to (>=)


It continues with the different ways of expressing the arithmetic methods:
- Addition (.+)
- Subtraction (.-)
- Multiplication (.*)
- Division (./ and .div)
- Module (.% and .modulo)


Finally, it concludes with the blocks that can be worked with the following methods:
- times
- upto
- downto
- step



## The main project description will soon be restructured to reflect the personal notes I have taken during the course.
